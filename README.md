# CPP CS Class Scheduler Mobile App

This was a Kotlin android app submitted as a final group project for CS 4750 - Mobile App Development at Cal Poly Pomona.
This app displays all Spring 2023 semester CS classes that were scraped from BroncoDirect
to the user. The app lets the user select and choose any amount of classes which will then be added
to their primary Google Calendar.
